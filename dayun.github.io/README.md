# Culinary Roots

Our project aims to create a lively website where people from different countries can share their traditional foods and the stories behind them. Each dish has a rich history that shows the culture and identity of its homeland. By bringing together people from various backgrounds in one online space, we want to celebrate our unique culinary heritage and create a sense of community through our love of food. This initiative highlights the flavors of the world and shares the fascinating stories that make these recipes special.
